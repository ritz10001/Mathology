# Mathology
This is a math-based library that I and a friend tried to create. It contains several different functions and operations for various subjects in math such as algebra, equations, trigonometry, geometry etc. We started working on this last December and have stopped working on it for the time being. However, it's unlikely work on this will be resumed.
